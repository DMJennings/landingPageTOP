For this project my goal is to get reaquainted with basic HTML and CSS. It has been about 9 months? since I really worked on any development projects.
Along with this goal I want to be able to use this as a baseline to help my wife with her upcoming projects that need a webpage. It does not have to be super interactive, therefore I belive this is the perfect opportunity to work towards that goal.
